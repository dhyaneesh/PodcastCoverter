#Podcast Scraper and Summarizer
Podcast Scraper and Summarizer is an app designed to help users save time and make it easier for them to get the information they need from their favorite podcasts.

The app allows users to scrape podcasts and receive a summary of their content. By entering the URL of the podcast and choosing the number of episodes to scrape, users can get a summary of the key topics and ideas covered in those episodes.

The app is built with Python 3 and uses the Beautiful Soup library for scraping the podcast, Whisper for Speech to text, and Flask for building the web app. It is available under the MIT license, and contributions are welcome via pull requests.
