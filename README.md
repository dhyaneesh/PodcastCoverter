# Podcast Scraper and Summarizer
Podcast Scraper and Summarizer is a powerful application that simplifies the process of listening to podcasts. Many people listen to podcasts on a regular basis, but sometimes they don't have time to listen to every episode or they may want to get a quick overview of the topics covered before diving into a longer episode. That's where this app comes in.

The app's main feature is its ability to scrape podcast episodes and generate a summary of the content covered. The user simply enters the URL of the podcast they want to scrape and selects the number of episodes they want to summarize. The app then uses the Beautiful Soup library to scrape the podcast website and extract the content from the selected episodes. Once it has this content, the app uses Whisper to process the audio and change it to text and generate a summary that highlights the key topics and ideas covered in those episodes.
